# transl8 sequence manipulation tools

This is a project I started mainly to learn rust by developing some sequence mainpulation tools.

# preparation

1. Install a rust toolchain, if you don't have one already by following the instructions at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
1. If you've just installed the toolchain, you probably want to exit your shell session and start another one so that the environment modifications take effect
1. Run ./install_local to build and install the tools into ~/opt.
